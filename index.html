	<h3> Chapter 1 </h3>
  <br>
	Measure constantly
  <br>
        "The predictive approach measures twice and cuts once, whereas the constantly approach is constantly measuring while making many small cuts"
  <br>
	"For one thing, the adaptive approaches to development depend on constant feedback from customers to support iteration"
    </p>

  <br>
    <p>
	<h3> Chapter 2 </h3>
  <br>
	Race to the middle
  <br>
  

  <br>

	""      "The fact is that the big guys like Oracle are becoming more agile through a steady diet of acquisitions. And the little guys are getting really smart in building interoperability into their applications.  In short, a race to the middle is taking place."
  <br>
	"Marketers cobble together "Franken-platforms" that an deliver amazing results, but that take a long time to deliver value. Worse still, all the technology often becomes a distraction from the fundamental tasks of connecting with customers in a simple, clear and concise fashion."
    </p>
 


  <br>

    <p>

	<h3> Chapter 3 </h3>

  <br>

	Digital Body Language

  <br>

	"The more a prospect shares about herself during the process the more she gets back in return The more a prospect shares about herself during the process the more she gets back in return from the marketer" 

   </p>

  <br>

   <p>
	<h3> Chapter 4 </h3>
   	
  <br>
	Internal comms

  <br>

	"Interestingly, the first principle ("individuals and interactions over processes and tools") is an example of an internal feedback loop that is actually being shortened. In fact, the conform to Agile principles, feedback loops must be implemented on multiple levels.""

  <br>

	"I'm saying that closer internal collaboration and a closer connection to customers is essential, and it's useful for marketers to take a page from development's book on this topic."
  <br>
	<h4>How to get started with Agile</h4>
	<ol>
	 <li>Ask around, talk it up.</li>
	 <li>Appoint or hire an Agile leader.</li>
	 <li>Create a game plan, assemble your resources.</li>
	 <li>Complete an iteration.</li>
	 <li>Share your results.</li>
	 <li>Return to step 4 and repeat.</li>
	</ol>
  <br>
   </p>

   <p>
	<h3> Chapter 6 </h3>
  <br>
	Scrum: A Service Development Method
  <br>
	"In other words its better to release on time than to delay a release in order to complete more work. When you translate this notion to the context of your list, sprint planning involves drawing a line under the last task that you can realistically perform within a specified time frame. To accomplish this, you'll have to have estimated the time needed to complete each story so that you can add up what is realistically possible within each iteration or timebox"  

  <br>
	<h4>"The costs of bad predictions"</h4>
	<ol>
	 <li>"It is impossible to gather all the requirements as the beginning of a project"</li>
	 <li>"Whatever requirements you do gather are guaranteed to change"</li>
	 <li>"There will always be more to do than time and money will allow"</li>
	</ol>
