 <br>
Measure constantly
<br>
 <br>
     "The predictive approach measures twice and cuts once, whereas the adaptive approach is constantly measuring while making many small cuts"
<br>
 <br>
     "For one thing, the adaptive approaches to development depend on constant feedback from customers to support iteration"

 <br>
Race to the middle
<br>
<br>

	"The fact is that the big guys like Oracle are becoming more agile through a steady diet of acquisitions. And the little guys are getting really smart in building interoperability into their applications.  In short, a race to the middle is taking place."
<br>
 <br>
      	"Marketers cobble together "Franken-platforms" that an deliver amazing results, but that take a long time to deliver value. Worse still, all the technology often becomes a distraction from the fundamental tasks of connecting with customers in a simple, clear and concise fashion."

Internal comms

<br>
 <br>
 
     "Interestingly, the first principle ("individuals and interactions over processes and tools") is an example of an internal feedback loop that is actually being shortened. In fact, the conform to Agile principles, feedback loops must be implemented on multiple levels.""

<br>

 <br>
     "I'm saying that closer internal collaboration and a closer connection to customers is essential, and it's useful for marketers to take a page from development's book on this topic."
<br>
 <br>
  <h4>How to get started with Agile</h4>
 <ol>
  <li>Ask around, talk it up.</li>
  <li>Appoint or hire an Agile leader.</li>
  <li>Create a game plan, assemble your resources.</li>
  <li>Complete an iteration.</li>
  <li>Share your results.</li>

 <br>
Scrum: A Service Development Method
<br>
 <br>
"In other words its better to release on time than to delay a release in order to complete more work. When you translate this notion to the context of your list, sprint planning involves drawing a line under the last task that you can realistically perform within a specified time frame. To accomplish this, you'll have to have estimated the time needed to complete each story so that you can add up what is realistically possible within each iteration or timebox"  

<br>
 <br>
  <h4>"The costs of bad predictions"</h4>
	<ol>
	 <li>"It is impossible to gather all the requirements as the beginning of a project"</li>
	 <li>"Whatever requirements you do gather are guaranteed to change"</li>
 	 <li>"There will always be more to do than time and money will allow"</li>

  <br>
 <br>
	Kanban
  <br>
 <br>
    "Moreover, unlike Scrum, Kanban does not prescribe timeboxing. Rather Kanban is constrained by the number of items that can be handled in each development stage at any one time."  
  <br>
 <br>
	"Where Scrum measured velocity (total number of story points per iteration), Kanban measured the average time it takes for an item to progress across the board , otherwise known as its cycle time." 
  <br>
 <br>
	"A Scrum Board is reset between each sprint | A Kanban Board is persistent."

	Alignment
  <br>
 <br>
    	"Alignment is indisputably the goal. But in reality it is the exception and not the rule."  
  <br>
 <br>
	"Recalling the principles of the Agile Manifesto, there is an emphasis on cross functional teams."
  <br>
 <br>
	"The key is to have cross-functional teams in each business unit and to have cross-functional participation across business units to ensure that the Agile teams stay in sync."
  <br>
 <br>
	Stacey + Nathan?
  <br>
 <br>
	"there is often a disconnect between project management's UX design team and marketing's UX design team. This disconnect undermines the company's ability to deliver a consistent user experience."
  <br>
 <br>
	Respond to feedback
  <br>
 <br>
	"the process of customer discovery over static prediction, flexible versus rigid planning, and responding to change over following a plan--it's not about having a strategy or plan, rather it's about responding to feedback."
  <br>
 <br>
	Experience Mapping Journey
  <br>
 <br>
	"experience mapping, which maps which maps a customer's across all touchpoints, can require time-consuming research and a significant investment.  Experience mapping yields insights for product or service enhancement, but it, too, does not fit directly into an Agile framework."
  <br>
 <br>

  <br>
 <br>
	Everything else is cost
  <br>
 <br>
	"Because the purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two--and only 2--basic functions: marketing and innovation. Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs. "  
  <br>
 <br>
	"So, communication is the first step but not a solution. What's needed are methods and practices that go beyond communication to action."
  <br>
 <br>
	Oracle ACE Program
  <br>
 <br>
	"Advocacy and peer-to-peer support communities, such as Oracle ACE Program, give a company's most influential users a platform through which to shape product innovation."
  <br>
 <br>
	"In other words, although there are usually many options that you could pursue, a good strategy dictates that there are only a few that you will actually pursue."

	Dependency Exercise - page 102 hardbound first edition not going to type the whole thing out now.
  <br>
 <br>
	Zero sum game theory
  <br>
 <br>
	"In this exercise it is useful to have each participant come up with his or her own rating of feasibility or importance before sharing with the team. By concealing the results in this way, you avoid introducing the form of cogitative bias known as anchoring, in which the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates."
  <br>
 <br>
	"Rather, the document embodies strategic insights and values to guide interpretation on an ongoing basis. It's also much faster to update this document than it is to create it from scratch, a process that is worth doing at least quarterly."

	"To modernize the marketing function, companies must tap into a whole array of customer feedback gathered at multiple levels: direct user feedback, feedback from research, strategic feedback, and feedback that comes in the form of data flowing into your integrated marketing platform."
  <br>

All channels work in concert, enabling brands to reach customers exactly where, how and when they want, regardless of channel, medium or device, online or offline. With the customer journey between devices, channels, and media becoming increasingly complex, and new forms of technology only making it more so, this strategy of paid/owned/earned confluence makes marketers impervious to the disruption caused by emerging technologies."

	"We do this by cultivating a relationships with members of our flagship advocacy program, the Oracle ACE program.  Members of the program are highly influential technology experts who are outspoken about Oracle technologies.  To get into the program, applicants must author technical papers or articles and develop other content that helps the community succeed with Oracle technologies."

  <br>
 <br>
	"In reality, buyers typically have more questions during and after a trial than before, and these later-stage questions tend to be more specific. It's at this point that buyers turn to use community for social proof.  Buyers in this phase seek three things from the community"
	<ol>
	 <li>"Confirmation that a community already exists, because no one wants to be the only customer of your product or service"</li>
	 <li>"Assurance that you are participating, listening and contributing "</li>
	 <li>"An indication that the community is satisfied with your products or services"</li>

	Transparency As Key
  <br>

	Topic Scoring
  <br>
 <br>
	"Topic scoring is a concept developed by the marketing automation world. It's based on user behavior both online and offline. The topic scoring model looks at customer behavior across all data sources -- event attendance, social interactions, website visits, downloads, and so on -- and assigns a score to each activity based on the degree to which it indicates interest in a topic. That score maps to a hierarchy of topics that are relevant in Oracle's business."

	"Define Content Types.  The goal here is to list and define the content types that you distribute (or would lie to distribute) through available channels. In my experience, teams sometimes struggle with this exercise because they confuse content types with channels or format. For example, a blog post is not a content type; it's a content format delivered via the blog channel (website). A weekly fashion tip is content type that a fashion retailer might create as a post on its blog but which might also be reformatted as a tweet for the Twitter channel."

	"At this point you should have a fleshed-out content grid, along with a set of stand-alone documents that support it."
  <br>
 <br>
	2 types of content!!
  <br>
 <br>
	<ol>
		<li>"Reference content that you periodically revise"</li>
		<li>"Serial content that builds on themes"</li>
	</ol>
  <br>
 <br>
	"Thus, it is important to track performance according to content type."

	Content strategy general principles
  <br>
 <br>
	"This second question points to a general principle of content strategy: namely, that each channel and each content type has unique affordance and opportunities associated with it."
  <br>
 <br>
	Content "Darn It"
  <br>
 <br>
	"Many companies have a tendency to distribute all content via all channels ("I invested in this content, darn it; I want to its full reward!"). This is generally not a smart approach, however, because channels become less differentiated and less effective for specific personas -- and they generally become cluttered. Plus, you limit your ability to give a potential customer a reason to opt into a new channel that may have greater affordances for engagement."

	"What's less common is a solution for aggregating data in ways that support the content strategy framework that I've aid out in this chapter. Today, many marketers use shared spreadsheets or wikis to capture data snapshots for content marketing exercises. Unfortunately, as the company developer a full portfolio of content, this can become unwieldy. For this reason, technologies that support content marketing have been a focus area of investment and innovation.  At Oracle, for instance, we have a content marketing solution that supports content planning, workflow, publishing, and analytics. In general, such technologies provide workflows that structure how source content is created and sliced and diced into derivative content."

	"modern leaders need to think beyond their organizational structure and work beyond what is natural in that structure. That's where the Agile team, and the focus on the goal, brings a cross-functional team together. It gives them something to unite around towards that North Star."
